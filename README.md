## Web App Title:

**VaahanBandhu – Circular Logistics for Driver Welfare & Sustainable Transport**

---

## A Brief of the Prototype:

**Interact with the UI of the website here** – [https://vahaan-bandhu.vercel.app/](https://vahaan-bandhu.vercel.app/)

VaahanBandhu, built by Team CODE4CHANGE, addresses rural India's inefficient agricultural transport network by enabling **circular logistics** for **truck drivers**, while maximizing outcomes for **farmers** and **input dealers**.

Using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Python AI models** in the backend, the app intelligently matches crop loads with available transport, reduces empty return trips, and ensures timely delivery through optimized routing. The system combines **classical AI** and **quantum computing techniques** to make route selection smarter and faster, while remaining affordable and scalable for rural communities.

## Quantum Computing Integration (Simplified Overview)

Here are the key quantum computing concepts used in the code:

### Qubit Encoding

* Traffic is encoded as qubits: `|0⟩ = bad`, `|1⟩ = good`.
* `qc.x(i)` flips qubits based on traffic score (e.g., >70% = good traffic).

### Quantum Entanglement

* `qc.cx(i, i+1)` gates create correlation between road segments.
* Helps evaluate connected routes as a unit (if one is bad, others likely are too).

### Measurement & Probabilistic Output

* `qc.measure_all()` collapses qubits into classical bits.
* The most frequent outcome (`max(counts)`) suggests the best path.

### Quantum Parallelism

* Evaluates **2ⁿ** routes at once using quantum superposition.

### Hybrid Approach

* Classical logic handles UI, maps, and API integrations.
* Quantum logic optimizes critical route segments (up to 5-qubit simulations).
* Results are visualized using **Folium** for map rendering.

This hybrid quantum-classical design demonstrates how **emerging quantum tech** can solve real-world challenges in logistics — even within today's hardware limits.

## Scalability, Sustainability, and Affordability Plan:

* **Farmer Reach**: Onboarding via FPOs, agri-input dealers, and regional agents.
* **Scalability**: Modular backend allows rollout to new geographies and logistics clusters.
* **Sustainability**: Revenue model from commercial transporters and analytics services.
* **Affordability**: Core services are free for farmers; subsidized via B2B partnerships.
